## Overview

Finding available tables at restaurants and bars, especially during peak hours, can be challenging. "ChoppeTaTable" is a fictional application that seeks to address this problem, allowing customers to reserve tables in advance, view real-time availability, and pre-pay for their experience, all in one platform.

## Key Features

1. **Table Reservation & Payment**:
    - Customers can conveniently book tables ahead of time, ensuring they have a spot during their desired time frame.
    - Users can pay in advance, facilitating a seamless dining or bar experience.

2. **Real-time Availability Check**:
    - Get instantaneous updates on table availability, reducing the uncertainty of finding a spot.

3. **NFC-Based Proof of Concept**:
    - To capture real-time table status, we integrated NFC stickers onto tables.
    - A Raspberry Pi equipped with an NFC reader identifies whether a table is occupied or free, updating the status with a simple NFC tag scan.

4. **Market Research**:
    - Conducted extensive market research, surveying over 200 students about their dining habits and challenges.
    - Interviewed more than ten restaurant and bar owners to gain insights into the industry's requirements and challenges.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Diners no longer have to wait in queues or hop from one place to another looking for available tables.
- **Predictability**: Restaurant and bar owners can predict rush hours and manage their inventory better with advanced reservations.
- **Innovation**: The NFC-based real-time status check offers an innovative solution to a long-standing problem, enhancing the user experience.
