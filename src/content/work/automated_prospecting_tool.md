## Overview

In the digital age, the traditional methods of lead generation are rapidly evolving. With the plethora of online businesses, the potential for B2B or B2C connections has grown exponentially. This project taps into that potential by enabling users to extract contact details directly from search results based on specific keywords, ensuring that businesses can connect with their target audience more effectively.

## Key Features

1. **User-Defined Search**: Through a simple and intuitive GUI using `Tkinter`, users can input specific search terms (e.g., "baker").

2. **Google Search Integration**: Post input, the software leverages the Google API to fetch search results corresponding to the given term.

3. **Web Scraping**: With the help of `Beautiful Soup`, the tool delves into the returned search results, navigating through various pages like 'Contact', 'Terms of Service', etc., to extract valuable contact information including:
    - Email Addresses
    - LinkedIn Profiles
    - Phone Numbers
    ... and more.

4. **Excel Integration**: The extracted contact details are organized and stored systematically in an Excel sheet using `pandas`, making it easy for businesses to access, analyze, and use the data for their prospecting efforts.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Automated scraping means businesses can gather leads at a fraction of the time it would take manually.
- **Relevance**: Custom searches ensure that the generated leads are tailored to the user's specific requirements, increasing the chances of successful outreach.
- **Organization**: Storing data in Excel provides a structured format that can easily be integrated into most CRM systems or used for further data analysis.
